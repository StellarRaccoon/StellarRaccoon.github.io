        <p>This site will include some notes and things. Things I've learned, things I want to keep track of. I find it hard to organize my notes so I hope that being able to customize them via website will help! It will also eventually look a bit better with CSS. </p>
        <p>I recently graduated college with a major in Computer Science and minor in Physics. I have an intrest in CAD softwares, planes, sewing, and tinkering. I like taking things apart and (trying) to put them back together. I want to start a career in embedded systems because I think the hardware and software interaction is really cool!</p>
